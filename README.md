# Analysis of dry season malaria cases in Kasungu
 This geospatial model uses routinely collected malaria case data, population data and remotely sensed data, such as open and vegetated water bodies, to estimate population living around open water bodies, and ultimately quantify the association between proximity to larval habitat and malaria risk in health facility catchment areas in Kasungu. The data used spans from 2017 to 2019 and was derived from digitized DHIS2 malaria records, aggregated population geospatial layer and TropWet tool in Google Earth Engine.
